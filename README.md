# Python PyGame Movement Template

This is a very simple and basic movement template. This is made for python using the PyGamer library. Pygame library is a common library used for making games in 
python.

I have also added comments in the parts of the code so that understanding what the specific line of code does is easier


NOTE: If the game window is not launching for you then you might not have pygame installed. Please install pygame before trying to use it
